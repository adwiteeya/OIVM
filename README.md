OIVM
====

These is proof of concept Virtual Machine, which has been written with the soul motivation of slowing the
process of reversing. The project has been completed in C language.

Kindly go through all the documents to see the model and architecture. Have fun. Experiment. :) 

Special thanks to Mr. Atul Alex Cherian for introducing to me the concept of an Abstract Processor.

I am currently working on OIVMx which is an extension to this project and aims at porting you executables to OIVM architecture.
